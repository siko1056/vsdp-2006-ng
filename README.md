# VSDP: Verified SemiDefinite Programming (Version 2006 by Christian Jansson)

VSDP is a MATLAB software package for rigorously solving semidefinite
programming problems.  It expresses these problems in a notation closely
related to the form given in textbooks and scientific papers.  Functions
for computing verified forward error bounds of the true optimal value and
verified certificates of feasibility and infeasibilityare provided.  All
rounding errors due to floating point arithmetic are taken into account.
Computational results are given, including results for the SDPLIB benchmark
problems.  This package supports interval input data and sparse format.
