</pre><p>The solver terminates without any warning if <code>info = 0</code>.  The first four
decimal digits of the primal and dual optimal value are correct, but week
duality is not satisfied since the approximate primal optimal value is
smaller than the dual one.  In other words, the algorithm is not backward
stable for this example.  Hence, for the nonzero coefficients about four
decimal digits are correct.</p><p>SDPA computes erroneous approximations together with a warning.</p><h2><a id="node5"><code>vsdplow</code> - rigorous lower bounds</a></h2><p>To obtain more reliability we can use the function <code>vsdplow</code> which computes
a verified lower bound of the primal optimal value by using previously
computed approximations <code>Xt</code>, <code>yt</code>, and <code>Zt</code>.  There are no assumptions about
the quality of <code>yt</code>.  First, we treat the situation where all components of
<code>xu</code> are infinite (i.e. finite bounds of the maximal eigenvalues of a primal
optimal solution <code>Xt</code> are not known or are not available).  The call has the
form:</p><pre class="oct-code">format longE
[fL, Y, dl] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">fL =   -5.00000014630378E-01

   1.04533121136103E-19
dl =    2.85719148772925E-13
</pre><p>The output <code>fL</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>dl</code> corresponds to the lower bound, the
certificate of dual feasibility, and the corresponding vector of eigenvalue
bounds, respectively.  In the case where <code>Y = NaN</code>, all components of the
vector <code>dl</code> are set <code>NaN</code>.</p><p>With SDPT3 a finite rigorous lower bound close to the optimal value together
with a certificate of dual feasibility is computed.  Since <code>dl</code> is positive,
the dual problem contains the strictly dual feasible interior point <code>Y</code>,
i.e. the dual Slater condition holds true.  Therefore, strong duality is
verified, and <code>fL</code> is also a lower bound of the dual optimal value.</p><p>Secondly, we describe the case, where additional information about finite
upper bounds <code>xu</code> of the maximal eigenvalues of a primal optimal solution
<code>Xt</code> is available.</p><p>If we use, as above, the upper bound <code>xu = 1e5</code>, then for this example we
obtain the same output:</p><p><b>Note:</b> tiny pertubation of <code>yt</code> neccessary to work with the approximation
from SDPT3-4.0 for this particular example.</p><pre class="pre-code">yt(2) = yt(2) - DELTA;</pre><pre class="oct-code">xu = 1e5;

Y = NaN
dl = NaN
</pre><p>We see that the quality of the rigorous results depends strongly on the
quality of the computed approximations, which is an immediate consequence
of the proposed error bound.</p><p>Using SDPA, the rigorous lower bound is minus infinity and no certificates
are computed, i.e. <code>Y = NaN</code>.</p><h2><a id="node6"><code>vsdpup</code> - rigorous upper bounds</a></h2><p>Similarly, with function <code>vsdpup</code> we can compute a verified upper bound <code>fU</code>
of the dual optimal value using the previously computed approximations.
There are no assumptions about the quality of the primal approximation <code>Xt</code>.</p><p>First, we treat the case where all components of <code>yu</code> are infinite and
describe shortly <code>vsdpup</code>.  The primal equations
$\sum_{j=1}^{n} \lbrace A_{ij}, X_{j} \rbrace = b_{i}$, $(i = 1,\ldots,m)$
are solved with a linear interval solver.  If an enclosure <code>X</code> containing an
exact solution of the primal equations can be computed, it is automatically
proved that the linear system of equations has full rank.  Then, with Weyl's
Perturbation Theorem (c.f. routine <code>veigsym</code>) verified lower bounds of the
eigenvalues for the blocks in <code>X</code> are computed and stored in a vector <code>lb</code>.
If <code>lb</code> is nonnegative, then <code>X</code> contains a primal feasible solution.
If <code>lb</code> is positive, then <code>X</code> contains a strictly primal feasible solution;
that is, the primal Slater condition holds true.  If <code>lb</code> has negative
components, then <code>vsdpup</code> tries to find iteratively new primal approximations
by solving appropriate perturbed semidefinite problems, until either <code>lb</code> is
nonnegative, or primal infeasibility is indicated by the semidefinite solver
for the perturbed problem.  In the latter case <code>vsdpup</code> sets <code>fU = +inf</code>,
and the certificate of primal feasibility <code>X</code> and the vector <code>lb</code> are defined
as <code>NaN</code>.  The call of <code>vsdpup</code> has the form:</p><pre class="oct-code">[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">fU =   -4.99999986522794E-01

    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000
}
lb =    2.00467558677218E-12
</pre><p>Hence, we obtain a lower bound of the optimal value together with the
interval matrix <code>X</code> containing a strictly feasible primal solution.
The radius of the first component is of order <code>10e−20</code>.  Since, <code>lb > 0</code>
Slater's condition is fulfilled and strong duality holds valid.</p><p>Using SDPA's approximations, we yield the upper bound plus infinity.</p><p>Summarizing, we have verified for the above problem with the SDPT3
approximations strong duality and the inequality</p><pre class="pre-code">-5.000000062262615e-001 <=  f* <= -4.999677693282600e-001,</pre><p>is fulfilled, and certificates of strictly primal and strictly dual feasible
solutions are computed.  The Strong Duality Theorem implies that the primal
and the dual problem have a nonempty compact set of optimal solutions.
The upper and lower bounds of the optimal value show a modest overestimation,
mainly due to the accuracy of SDPT3.  The bounds are rigorous, and thus
satisfy weak duality.</p><p>In the case where finite upper bounds <code>yu</code> are available, <code>vsdpup</code> computes
rigorously the finite upper bound <code>fU</code> without verifying primal feasibility.
Hence, solving the primal equations with a linear interval solver is not
necessary, yielding an acceleration in most cases.  The fact that primal
feasibility is not verified is expressed in <code>vsdpup</code> by <code>NaN</code> for <code>X</code> and
<code>lb</code>.  The call of <code>vsdpup</code> with using finite upper bounds has the form</p><pre class="oct-code">yu = 1e5 * [1 1 1 1]<span class="string">';</span>
[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt,yu)</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">fU =   -4.99998275348973E-01
X = NaN
lb = NaN
</pre><p>For this example the upper bound is worse than the previous one.</p><h2><a id="node7"><code>vsdpinfeas</code> - certificates of infeasibility</a></h2><p>The following results are very similar for the SDPT3 and for the SDPA
approximations.  For this example the upper bound is worse than the previous
one.  For negative <code>DELTA</code> our problem is primal and dual infeasible.</p><pre class="oct-code">DELTA = -1e-4;

</pre><p>gives the termination code 1 with the warning primal infeasibility has
deteriorated too much.  In accordance the rigorous lower bound is</p><pre class="oct-code">format longE
[fL, Y, dL] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">fL = -Inf

</pre><p>and for the upper bound we obtain</p><pre class="oct-code">[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">fU = Inf
X = NaN
lb = NaN
</pre><p>Notice that these are the exact optimal values, since the problem is primal
and dual infeasible.  However, <code>vsdplow</code> and <code>vsdpup</code> only indicate
infeasibility, but do not proof this property (both certificates are <code>NaN</code>).
This is the task of <code>vsdpinfeas</code> which tries to verify primal or dual
unbounded rays that deliver certificates of dual or primal infeasibility.
For proving primal infeasibility we can use <code>vsdpinfeas</code> as follows:</p><pre class="oct-code">choose = <span class="string">'p'</span>;
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose,Xt,yt,Zt);

format short; isinfeas
format longE; X, Y</pre><pre class="oct-code-output">isinfeas = 0
X = NaN
Y = NaN
</pre><p>The first line declares that we want to prove primal infeasibility.  In the
second line the input of <code>vsdpinfeas</code> contains the data of the problem and
the selection variable choose as well as the previously computed SDPT3
approximations <code>Xt</code>, <code>yt</code>, and <code>Zt</code>.  Since <code>isinfeas = 0</code> the routine
<code>vsdpinfeas</code> has not proved primal infeasibility for this example, and the
certificates <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> are set to <code>NaN</code>.</p><p>The reason is that each dual improving <code>Y</code> ray has a zero eigenvalue, and
positive semidefiniteness cannot be verified for matrices with zero
eigenvalues.  This is out of scope of VSDP (analogous results are obtained
for dual infeasility).</p><p>The example</p><pre class="oct-code">clear C A b blk

C{1} = [0 0; 0 0];
A{1,1} = [1 0; 0 0];
A{2,1} = [0 1; 1 0.005];
b = [-0.01 1]<span class="string">';</span>
blk(1,:) = {<span class="string">'s'</span>; 2};</pre><pre class="oct-code-output"></pre><p>is primal infeasible, since the first primal equation implies
<code>X(1,1) = -0.01</code>.  Hence, <code>X</code> cannot be positive semidefinite.</p><pre class="oct-code">choose = <span class="string">'p'</span>;
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose);

format short; isinfeas

X = NaN
Y =
  -1.00005669979647E+02
  -5.66997964726515E-05
</pre><p>Now, <code>isinfeas = 1</code> shows that the problem is primal infeasible and a
rigorous certificate is provided by the dual improving ray <code>Y</code>.  Observe
that vsdpinfeas can be called also without the optional input <code>Xt</code>, <code>yt</code>,
and <code>Zt</code>.  Then appropriate approximations are generated in this routine,
with the consequence of more computational effort.  Since this example is
dual feasible, proving dual infeasibility should not be successful:</p><pre class="oct-code">choose = <span class="string">'d'</span>;
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose);

</pre><h2><a id="node8">SDPLIB benchmarks (here from Truss Topology Design)</a></h2><p>For computing verified results of the SDPLIB collection it is required that
these problems are encoded in SDPA sparse format and stored in an appropriate
directory.  This version of VSDP supplies the problem instances inside the
directory <code>sdplib_vsdp</code>.  In this example we take the third SDPLIB problem
which is <code>arch4.dat-s</code> from truss topology design:</p><pre class="oct-code">arch4_path = ...

converts it to VSDP format:</p><pre class="oct-code">[blk,A,C,b] = sdpa_to_vsdp(arch4_path);</pre><pre class="oct-code-output"></pre><p>The size of the problem can be obtained with</p><pre class="oct-code">format short

}

</pre><p>Hence, this is a block diagonal problem consisting of two symmetric blocks
with dimensions 161 and 174 (yielding 28266 variables), and it has <code>m = 174</code>
constraints.  At first, we solve this problem approximately with SDPT3, and
then we compute the rigorous error bounds for the optimal value.</p><pre class="oct-code">[objt,Xt,yt,Zt,info] = mysdps(blk,A,C,b);

</pre><p>The bounds for the optimal value provide a guaranteed accuracy of about eight
decimal digits for this example.  The time for computing the lower bound is
small compared to the times for the approximations and for the upper bound.
This behavior is very typical.  There are two reasons.  Firstly, solving the
primal equations with a linear interval solver is time consuming.  Secondly,
solving perturbed semidefinite programming problems during the iteration is
also time consuming.</p><p>The computed quantities <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are both unequal <code>NaN</code> with positive

%% Demonstration of VSDP: Verified SemiDefinite Programming
%
% VSDP is a software package computing verified results for SDP-problems
%
% $$
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{array}{lll}
% \text{minimize}
% & \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \langle C_{j}, X_{j}\rangle, & \\
% \text{subject to}
% & \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \langle A_{i,j}, X_{j}\rangle = b_{i},
% & i = 1, \ldots, m, \\
% & X_{j} \succeq 0,
% & j = 1, \ldots, n,
% \end{array}
% \end{equation}
% $$
%
% where $\langle C, X\rangle := trace(CX)$.
%%

%% Installation
%
% VSDP is completely written in MATLAB and uses
%
% * the the MATLAB-toolbox INTLAB (INTerval LABoratory), which is available
%   from <http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/rump/intlab>,
% * the semidefinite solver SDPT3 <http://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/sdpt3.html>,
%   a more recent version is available from <https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3>,
% * or alternatively the semidefinite solver SDPA
%   <http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/>.
%
% The VSDP source files can be downloaded from
% <http://www.ti3.tuhh.de/jansson/vsdp2006> or a more recent version from
% <https://github.com/siko1056/vsdp-2006-ng>.
% The installation was successful if this script |demovsdp.m| runs through.
%



%% First example
%
% VSDP exploits the block-diagonal structure by cell-arrays:
%
% The j-th block |C{j}| and the blocks |A{i,j}| for |i = 1,...,m|
% are real symmetric matrices of common size |s_j|.
%
% This structure is described with the cell-array
%
%   blk(j,:) = {'s'; s_j};
%
% For the purpose of illustration, we start with the following semidefinite
% programming problem of dimension |m = 4|, |n = 1|, and |s_1 = 3|, i.e. the
% matrices consist of only one block.  The problem depends on a fixed parameter
% |DELTA|:
%

DELTA = 1e-4;

C{1} = [ 0   1/2    0;
        1/2 DELTA   0;
         0    0   DELTA];

A{1,1} = [  0  -1/2 0;
          -1/2   0  0;
            0    0  0];

A{2,1} = [1 0 0;
          0 0 0;
          0 0 0];

A{3,1} = [0 0 1;
          0 0 0;
          1 0 0];

A{4,1} = [0 0 0;
          0 0 1;
          0 1 0];

b = [1; 2*DELTA; 0; 0];

blk(1,:) = {'s'; 3};


%%
% It is easy to prove that for every
%
% * |DELTA > 0|: the optimal value is -0.5, and strong duality holds,
% * |DELTA = 0|: ill-posed problem with nonzero duality gap,
% * |DELTA < 0|: primal and dual infeasible.
%



%% |vsdpcheck| - check the problem data
%
% The routine |vsdpcheck| may be used to perform a check whether there are
% inconsistencies in the input data:
%

format short
[m, n] = vsdpcheck(blk,A,C,b)

%%
% Since no error messages occur, all checks w.r.t. the sizes and the data
% types of the input data are carried out correctly.
%



%% |mysdps| - computing approximations only
%
% VSDP can be used for computing only approximations with different solvers.
% The user can integrate other solvers very easily in the file |mysdps.m|.
% By default, the function |mysdps| calls the semidefinite programming solver
% SDPT3.  Different solvers can be chosen by setting the global variable
% |VSDP_CHOICE_SDP| in the file |SDP_GLOBALPARAMETER.m|.
%
% * |VSDP_CHOICE_SDP = 1|: SDPT3 is selected (default)
% * |VSDP_CHOICE_SDP = 2|: SDPA is selected
%
% We want to illustrate that the proposed rigorous error bounds depend very
% much on the quality of the computed approximations.
%

[objt,Xt,yt,Zt,info] = mysdps(blk,A,C,b);

%%
% The output consists of approximations of
%
% # the primal and dual optimal value both stored in |objt|,
% # the primal and dual solutions |Xt|, |yt|, |Zt|, and
% # information about termination and performance stored in |info|.
%

format longE
objt, X = Xt{1}, yt

%%
%

format short; info

%%
% The solver terminates without any warning if |info = 0|.  The first four
% decimal digits of the primal and dual optimal value are correct, but week
% duality is not satisfied since the approximate primal optimal value is
% smaller than the dual one.  In other words, the algorithm is not backward
% stable for this example.  Hence, for the nonzero coefficients about four
% decimal digits are correct.
%
% SDPA computes erroneous approximations together with a warning.
%



%% |vsdplow| - rigorous lower bounds
%
% To obtain more reliability we can use the function |vsdplow| which computes
% a verified lower bound of the primal optimal value by using previously
% computed approximations |Xt|, |yt|, and |Zt|.  There are no assumptions about
% the quality of |yt|.  First, we treat the situation where all components of
% |xu| are infinite (i.e. finite bounds of the maximal eigenvalues of a primal
% optimal solution |Xt| are not known or are not available).  The call has the
% form:
%

format longE
[fL, Y, dl] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)

%%
% The output |fL|, |Y|, and |dl| corresponds to the lower bound, the
% certificate of dual feasibility, and the corresponding vector of eigenvalue
% bounds, respectively.  In the case where |Y = NaN|, all components of the
% vector |dl| are set |NaN|.
%
% With SDPT3 a finite rigorous lower bound close to the optimal value together
% with a certificate of dual feasibility is computed.  Since |dl| is positive,
% the dual problem contains the strictly dual feasible interior point |Y|,
% i.e. the dual Slater condition holds true.  Therefore, strong duality is
% verified, and |fL| is also a lower bound of the dual optimal value.
%
% Secondly, we describe the case, where additional information about finite
% upper bounds |xu| of the maximal eigenvalues of a primal optimal solution
% |Xt| is available.
%
% If we use, as above, the upper bound |xu = 1e5|, then for this example we
% obtain the same output:
%

%%
% *Note:* tiny pertubation of |yt| neccessary to work with the approximation
% from SDPT3-4.0 for this particular example.
%
%   yt(2) = yt(2) - DELTA;
%

xu = 1e5;
[fL, Y, dl] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt,xu)

%%
% We see that the quality of the rigorous results depends strongly on the
% quality of the computed approximations, which is an immediate consequence
% of the proposed error bound.
%
% Using SDPA, the rigorous lower bound is minus infinity and no certificates
% are computed, i.e. |Y = NaN|.
%



%% |vsdpup| - rigorous upper bounds
%
% Similarly, with function |vsdpup| we can compute a verified upper bound |fU|
% of the dual optimal value using the previously computed approximations.
% There are no assumptions about the quality of the primal approximation |Xt|.
%
% First, we treat the case where all components of |yu| are infinite and
% describe shortly |vsdpup|.  The primal equations
% $\sum_{j=1}^{n} \lbrace A_{ij}, X_{j} \rbrace = b_{i}$, $(i = 1,\ldots,m)$
% are solved with a linear interval solver.  If an enclosure |X| containing an
% exact solution of the primal equations can be computed, it is automatically
% proved that the linear system of equations has full rank.  Then, with Weyl's
% Perturbation Theorem (c.f. routine |veigsym|) verified lower bounds of the
% eigenvalues for the blocks in |X| are computed and stored in a vector |lb|.
% If |lb| is nonnegative, then |X| contains a primal feasible solution.
% If |lb| is positive, then |X| contains a strictly primal feasible solution;
% that is, the primal Slater condition holds true.  If |lb| has negative
% components, then |vsdpup| tries to find iteratively new primal approximations
% by solving appropriate perturbed semidefinite problems, until either |lb| is
% nonnegative, or primal infeasibility is indicated by the semidefinite solver
% for the perturbed problem.  In the latter case |vsdpup| sets |fU = +inf|,
% and the certificate of primal feasibility |X| and the vector |lb| are defined
% as |NaN|.  The call of |vsdpup| has the form:
%

[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)

%%
% Hence, we obtain a lower bound of the optimal value together with the
% interval matrix |X| containing a strictly feasible primal solution.
% The radius of the first component is of order |10e−20|.  Since, |lb > 0|
% Slater's condition is fulfilled and strong duality holds valid.
%
% Using SDPA's approximations, we yield the upper bound plus infinity.
%
% Summarizing, we have verified for the above problem with the SDPT3
% approximations strong duality and the inequality
%
%   -5.000000062262615e-001 <=  f* <= -4.999677693282600e-001,
%
% is fulfilled, and certificates of strictly primal and strictly dual feasible
% solutions are computed.  The Strong Duality Theorem implies that the primal
% and the dual problem have a nonempty compact set of optimal solutions.
% The upper and lower bounds of the optimal value show a modest overestimation,
% mainly due to the accuracy of SDPT3.  The bounds are rigorous, and thus
% satisfy weak duality.
%
% In the case where finite upper bounds |yu| are available, |vsdpup| computes
% rigorously the finite upper bound |fU| without verifying primal feasibility.
% Hence, solving the primal equations with a linear interval solver is not
% necessary, yielding an acceleration in most cases.  The fact that primal
% feasibility is not verified is expressed in |vsdpup| by |NaN| for |X| and
% |lb|.  The call of |vsdpup| with using finite upper bounds has the form
%

yu = 1e5 * [1 1 1 1]';
[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt,yu)

%%
% For this example the upper bound is worse than the previous one.
%



%% |vsdpinfeas| - certificates of infeasibility
%
% The following results are very similar for the SDPT3 and for the SDPA
% approximations.  For this example the upper bound is worse than the previous
% one.  For negative |DELTA| our problem is primal and dual infeasible.
%

DELTA = -1e-4;

C{1} = [ 0   1/2    0;
        1/2 DELTA   0;
         0    0   DELTA];

b = [1; 2*DELTA; 0; 0];

%%
% The routine SDPT3
%

[objt,Xt,yt,Zt,info] = mysdps(blk,A,C,b);

%%
%

format short; info

%%
% gives the termination code 1 with the warning primal infeasibility has
% deteriorated too much.  In accordance the rigorous lower bound is
%

format longE
[fL, Y, dL] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)

%%
% and for the upper bound we obtain
%

[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt)

%%
% Notice that these are the exact optimal values, since the problem is primal
% and dual infeasible.  However, |vsdplow| and |vsdpup| only indicate
% infeasibility, but do not proof this property (both certificates are |NaN|).
% This is the task of |vsdpinfeas| which tries to verify primal or dual
% unbounded rays that deliver certificates of dual or primal infeasibility.
% For proving primal infeasibility we can use |vsdpinfeas| as follows:
%

choose = 'p';
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose,Xt,yt,Zt);

format short; isinfeas
format longE; X, Y

%%
% The first line declares that we want to prove primal infeasibility.  In the
% second line the input of |vsdpinfeas| contains the data of the problem and
% the selection variable choose as well as the previously computed SDPT3
% approximations |Xt|, |yt|, and |Zt|.  Since |isinfeas = 0| the routine
% |vsdpinfeas| has not proved primal infeasibility for this example, and the
% certificates |X|, |Y| are set to |NaN|.
%
% The reason is that each dual improving |Y| ray has a zero eigenvalue, and
% positive semidefiniteness cannot be verified for matrices with zero
% eigenvalues.  This is out of scope of VSDP (analogous results are obtained
% for dual infeasility).
%

%%
% The example
%

clear C A b blk

C{1} = [0 0; 0 0];
A{1,1} = [1 0; 0 0];
A{2,1} = [0 1; 1 0.005];
b = [-0.01 1]';
blk(1,:) = {'s'; 2};

%%
% is primal infeasible, since the first primal equation implies
% |X(1,1) = -0.01|.  Hence, |X| cannot be positive semidefinite.
%

choose = 'p';
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose);

format short; isinfeas
format longE; X, Y

%%
% Now, |isinfeas = 1| shows that the problem is primal infeasible and a
% rigorous certificate is provided by the dual improving ray |Y|.  Observe
% that vsdpinfeas can be called also without the optional input |Xt|, |yt|,
% and |Zt|.  Then appropriate approximations are generated in this routine,
% with the consequence of more computational effort.  Since this example is
% dual feasible, proving dual infeasibility should not be successful:
%

choose = 'd';
[isinfeas, X, Y] = vsdpinfeas(blk,A,C,b,choose);

format short; isinfeas
format longE; X, Y


%% SDPLIB benchmarks (here from Truss Topology Design)
%
% For computing verified results of the SDPLIB collection it is required that
% these problems are encoded in SDPA sparse format and stored in an appropriate
% directory.  This version of VSDP supplies the problem instances inside the
% directory |sdplib_vsdp|.  In this example we take the third SDPLIB problem
% which is |arch4.dat-s| from truss topology design:
%

arch4_path = ...
  fullfile(fileparts(which('demovsdp')), 'sdplib_vsdp', 'arch4.dat-s');

%%
% The routine |sdpa_to_vsdp| reads such a problem in SDPA sparse format, and
% converts it to VSDP format:
%

[blk,A,C,b] = sdpa_to_vsdp(arch4_path);

%%
% The size of the problem can be obtained with
%

format short
s_j = blk(:,2)
m   = length(b)


%%
% Hence, this is a block diagonal problem consisting of two symmetric blocks
% with dimensions 161 and 174 (yielding 28266 variables), and it has |m = 174|
% constraints.  At first, we solve this problem approximately with SDPT3, and
% then we compute the rigorous error bounds for the optimal value.
%

[objt,Xt,yt,Zt,info] = mysdps(blk,A,C,b);
[fL, Y, dl] = vsdplow(blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt);
[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup (blk,A,C,b,Xt,yt,Zt);

format longE
objt, fL, fU

%%
% The bounds for the optimal value provide a guaranteed accuracy of about eight
% decimal digits for this example.  The time for computing the lower bound is
% small compared to the times for the approximations and for the upper bound.
% This behavior is very typical.  There are two reasons.  Firstly, solving the
% primal equations with a linear interval solver is time consuming.  Secondly,
% solving perturbed semidefinite programming problems during the iteration is
% also time consuming.
%
% The computed quantities |X| and |Y| are both unequal |NaN| with positive
% minimal eigenvalue bounds
%

min(lb), min(dl)

%%
% Hence, for |arch4.dat-s| strictly primal and dual feasible solutions are
% verified, implying strong duality and compactness of the sets of optimal
% solutions.
%


%% VSDP with interval input data
%
% If the input data of a semidefinite programming problem are intervals then
% the rigorous bounds computed by VSDP hold valid for all problems with real
% input data inside the intervals.  In the following, we solve again the Truss
% Topology Design Problem |arch4.dat-s| with interval input data:
%

[blk,A,C,b] = sdpa_to_vsdp(arch4_path);

%%
%

r = 1e-8;
m = length(b);
n = length(C);

for j = 1:n
  CI{j} = midrad(C{j},r*abs(C{j}));
  for i = 1:m
    AI{i,j} = midrad(A{i,j},r*abs(A{i,j}));
  end
end

bI = midrad(b,r*abs(b));

%%
% Compute an approximate solution using SDPT3 and a rigorous lower and upper
% bound.
%

[objt,Xt,yt,Zt,info] = mysdps(blk,A,C,b);
[fL, Y, dL] = vsdplow(blk,AI,CI,bI,Xt,yt,Zt);
[fU, X, lb] = vsdpup (blk,AI,CI,bI,Xt,yt,Zt);

fL, fU

%%
% For |arch4.dat-s| the optimal value for all problems with real input data
% inside the intervals is between |fL| and |fU|.  Hence, a relative
% perturbation radius of $10^{-8}$ yields a relative radius of
% $4.9 \cdot 10^{-5}$ for the set of optimal values.  Looking at the other
% output data it follows that |Y| is a strictly dual feasible solution for all
% real problems, and the interval quantity |X| contains for each real problem
% a strictly primal feasible solution.  Especially, strong duality holds valid
% for all real problems.
%
% VSDP has further features, for example:
%
% * Certificates of infeasibility
% * Other data formats (sparse, interval)
% * Verified solutions for underdetermined systems
% * Verified eigenvalue bounds
% * Conversion routines for SDPA and SDPT3 format
% * Applications
